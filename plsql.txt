introduction
==========
If you want to reuse or save the sql queries on the database server and execute later we can use stored procedure

CREATE PROCEDURE is the statement which is used to create the PROCEDURE

Example
=======
The following sql statement 

SELECT
   M.NAME,C.NAME FROM MEMBERS M
    ,COMMITTEE C
   ORDER BY M.nAME;

can be stored and execute later and reuse it using below syntax by creating procedure

DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE `GETList1`()
BEGIN
SELECT
   M.NAME,C.NAME FROM MEMBERS M
    ,COMMITTEE C
   ORDER BY M.nAME;
END

DELIMITER ;

Advantages of procedures
=====================
We can reduce traffic by sending only one name(procedure name) to the server instead of multiple lengthy SQL statements.
we make database more secure by adding more privileges and hiding table definitions

disadvantages of procedures
=======================
troubleshooting is main disadvantage

How to define variable in procedure?

DECLARE statement is used to define the variables in Procedures/routine

INT
VARCHAR
DATETIME  etc., any MYSQL  Data Types

IN parameter
============
when you define IN parameter along with procedure or function we have to pass an argument/parameter to the stored procedure
In value is Protected,means the value of IN parameter is unchanged after the end of the procedure.

OUT parameter
=============
when you define OUT parameter alond with procedure of function it returns the values passed from the procedure(to return the value).

INOUT parameter
===============
Parameter which is defined as INOUT  can pass the value and return the value to and from the procedure.

Functions in MySQL
================

Function is a set of SQL statements that perform an operation and returns a single value.


Example:
========
create function addition (a int,b int)
returns int
DETERMINISTIC
 begin
declare result int;
set result =0;
 set result = a + b;
 return result;
end  $$

The function parameter may contain IN,OUT,INOUT parameters but you cannot use this keywords while declaring.
Function returns only a single value mentioned in function header
we can call function inside the procedures or other functions or sql statements

CURSORS
========
pointers to the rows in the table

Read-only
=======
you cannot update the data through cursor
Non-Scrollable
===========
we can fetch only few rows in the determined order (means we cannot fetch the data in reverse order)
Asensitive
========
    Asensitive
==========
        cursor points to actual data 
    InSensitive
============
       cursor points to temporary copy of the data

Steps to create the cursor in MySQL
=============================
1. Open cursor
2. fetch cursor data into variables list
3.close cursor
