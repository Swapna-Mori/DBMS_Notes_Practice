DataBase?

Organized Collection of interrelated data stored in a server/computer.

ACID Properties
=============
Atomicity
Consistency
Isolation
Durability

Relationships TYpes among the data to store effectively using ACID properties and retrieve easily

1.  One to One Relationship
2.  Many to One Relationship
3. One to Many Relationship
4. Many to Many Relationship

Importance of DB?
===============
- For handlng large amount of different types of data with ease.
- Systematically we can retrieve,filter and sort and update data efficiently and    accurately

Types of DB Model
===============
defining logical structure of the database to store ,organize and manipulate the data

There are 4 common types of db model
================================
Hierarchial DBs
Network DBs
Relational DBs
Object Oriented DBs

Hierarchial DBs
============
It oldest db model developed by IBM for information management.


Network DBs
==========
Hierarchial Model + many to many relationshihp
it is officially stated by CODASYL (Conference on Data Systems Lanuage)

Relational DBs or SQL databases
===========================
MySql
DB2 (IBM)
Postgre
Oracle
H2
HSQL
SQLServer etc.,

Here Data is categorized in to different tables called as Relations
Each Relation or Table or Entity includes set of rows and columns.
Each column holds attribute of the entity

Example
=======
Customer => customerid,customername,customeremail,customermobileno etc.,

In above example

Customer => Entity => Table => Relation
customerid,customername etc,m => attributes of entity => columns
values of above attributes are stored as row => tuple => which holds all the details of a entity as a row
Degree of a Table or Relation => number of attributes in a table
cardinality => number of rows/tuples in the table

The above generates all relationships or Associations  like 
one to one
one to many
many to one
many to many

This database follows certain rules to store the data across different tables called as Normalization

Normalization helps to reduce the redundancy(repetition/duplicate) of the data (ACID)

in 1970 by E.F.Codd


Object Oriented DBs
================
OOD follows all the principles of OOPS like class,object,inheritance,polymorphism,encapsulation and abstraction

What is DBMS?
============
an application software to create,delete,update and administer data

Components of DBMS
=================
Hardware => DIsk and RAM,keyboard,monitor etc,
Software => Mysql or Oracle
Data => information collected 
Procedures => rules that help in using DBMS
DB Access Language => Query Language to perform operations like create,read,update and delete

characteristics of DBMS
===================

DBMS supports ACID Properties
it stores any kind of data like images,videos,files etc,
BackUp and Recovery
Duplicate data can be reduced
sharing of data is easy
supports data security and restriction to unauthorized access

Application of DBMS
================
Banking System
Telecom
Airlines
Online shoppling
Education etc.

Advantages of DBMS
================
DBMS Duplicate data (data redundancy) is very less or not present
In DBMS  data stored is consistent (Inconsistency is removed)
we can share data among different applications and users
we can search and fetch the data from different servers
 we can limit the access to the data by defining privileges or permissions
DBMS uses software locking mechanism that prevents the same set of data from being changed by two people at the same time
DBMS can integrate the data from different locations
DBMS supports in quality business decisions
DBMS provides set or commands to reduce the time for access of data by writing simple queries using this commands
DBMS restores the data to previous state if case of any crash
DBMS support tuning techniques to improve the performance
Data loss is almost eliminated
Any trasaction to dbms will be treated  as atomic transaction,to complete the transaction or rollback transaction 



DBMS Disadvantages
=================
Cost of hardware and software
technical staff
Managing the complexity of DB
Frequent upgrade or Management of Data 

Types of DBMS
============
NoSQL
ER Model
SQL
Document
Network
Graph database
Hierarchial DB 

Normalization in DBMS
==================

Normalization is defined as process to remove duplicate/redundant data among different tables to ensure data integrity.
Which supports the CRUD (Cread,Read update and Delete)
Normalization removes anomalies like
    insert anamoly
    delete anamoly
    update anamoly





SQL
====
Structured Query Language

which is set of commands to manipulate the database
these set of comands are divided into 4 parts

1.DDL (Data Definition Language) => create or remove and change the table in database
====================================================================
create
alter
drop
truncate
2.DML (Data Manipulation Language) => create or remove or change values in the table
===================================================================
insert
update and
delete
3.DCL (Data Control Language) => to set the privileges for accessing db
======================================================
grant
revoke
4.TCL (Transaction Control Language) 
======================================
=> to commit or roll back the database transactions(create,read,update and delete) of data in table
commit
rollback
savepoint

5. DQL (Data Query Language) => to retrieve the data using select statment
============================================================
select

DataTypes in MySQL
================
Numeric DataTypes
=================
int ,tinyint,smallint,mediumint,bigint,float(m,d),double(m,d),decimal(m,d),bit(m),bool,boolean
String DataTypes
=================
char(size),varchar(size),Tinytext,text,mediumtext,longtext,binary,varbinday,enum,et

BLOB (Binary Large Object Data Types)
================================
Tinybolb = 255 bytes
blob = 65,535 bytes
mediumblob = 16,777,215 bytes
longblob = 4gb

Date Data Types
=============
Year [(2|4)]  => 2 digit or 4 digit => by default 4 digits are stored
DATE => 'yyyy-mm-dd' => 1000 -01-01 to 9999-12-31
TIME => 'HH:MM:SS'
DATETIME => 'yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS'
TIMESTAMP => 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' => time + UTC

Constraints in MySQL
=================
rule on data 

to specify or restrict data values to store in the table

Constraints are defined on table to ensure data accuracy and integrity.

Example
=======

studentage cannot be > 120 => column level constraint


Two Types of Constraints
====================
Column level Constraints => constraints that limits to a particular column to insert particular data
example : not null,unique,check,default etc,
Table level Constraints => constraints that are applied on entire table that limits the data insertion on whole table
example: primary key,foriegn key


List of Constraints in MySQL
======================
NOT NULL
CHECK
DEFAULT
PRIMARY KEY
AUTO_INCREMENT
ENUM
FOREIGN KEY
INDEX
UNIQUE 

Adding Constraint while creating the table
=================================
create table course(courseid int,coursename varchar(20) not null);

MySQL Engines
============

MyISAM
======
   ISAM storage (indexed sequential access method)
   SIze of the MYISAM table 256TB
   MYISAM tables compressed and readonly
  MYISAM tables are not transaction safe

MYISAM is the default engine before version 5.5
  
InnoDB
======
This is the default engine after version 5.5

supports all ACID properties
optimal for performance
it supports portablity across different platforms and OS
supports foreign keys,commit,rollback operations
SIze of the MYISAM table 64TB
